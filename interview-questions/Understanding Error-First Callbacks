What is an error-first callback?

Error-first callbacks are used to pass errors and data as well. You have to pass the error as the first parameter, 
and it has to be checked to see if something went wrong. Additional arguments are used to pass data.

Thereâ€™s really only two rules for defining an error-first callback:

1.  The first argument of the callback is reserved for an error object. If an error occurred, it will be returned by 
    the first err argument.
2.  The second argument of the callback is reserved for any successful response data. If no error occurred, err will 
    be set to null and any successful data will be returned in the second argument.
