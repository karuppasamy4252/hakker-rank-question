What is JSON Web Token? 

Response: Is a open standard(RFC) that defines a compact and self-conatined war for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

When should you use JSON Web Token? 

1- Authentication is the most scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent resquest will include the JWT.
2 - Information exchange, JWT is a good way of securely transmitting information between parties.

    Header
    Payload
