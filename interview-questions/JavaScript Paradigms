Can you name two pragramming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?

Response: JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural programming along with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and functional programming. JavaScript supports OOP with prototypal inheritance.

Good to hear:

    - Prototypal Inheritance (objects without classes, and prototype delegation, aka OLOO — Objects Linking to Other Objects), andPrototypal inheritance (also: prototypes, OLOO).
    - Functional programming (enabled by lambdas with closure)(also: closures, first class functions, lambdas).

Red flags:

    No clue what a paradigm is, no mention of prototypal oo or functional programming.
